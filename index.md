## Tree Pickup

On the planting days listed above, neighbors will be able to pick up and plant their trees, with help and advice from volunteers.  Free bulk mulch and soil amendments will be available.

## Plant Swap

Planting days will feature a plant swap, where neighbors are encouraged to bring starts, divisions and seeds of garden or house plants that they would like to share.
